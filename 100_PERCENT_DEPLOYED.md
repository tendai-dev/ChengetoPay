  echo -n "Port $port: "
  curl -s "http://localhost:$port/health" 2>/dev/null | grep -o "healthy" || echo "N/A"
done
```

### Create a Test Transaction Flow:
```bash
# 1. Create Escrow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/escrows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 1000, "currency": "USD", "parties": ["buyer", "seller"]}'

# 2. Process Payment
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/api/v1/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"escrow_id": "xxx", "amount": 1000}'

# 3. Trigger Risk Assessment
curl http://localhost:8085/v1/status
